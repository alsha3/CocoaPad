 CocoaPad -- main.m
 By Henry Weiss
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 There's not much in here.  As you can see, all the "main.m" file does is do
 NSApplicationMain, which basically means load the nib file and get to work.
 The REAL program code is in the MyDocument class, InterfaceController and
 PreferencesController classes.
