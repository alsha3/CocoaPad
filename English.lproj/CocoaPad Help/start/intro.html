<p>Why another word processor?  Most, like Microsoft Word, are big, honking, feature-ridden programs that have a lot of unnecessary bloat.

<p>If you need a fairly lean word processor that has a bit more than TextEdit can give you, then use CocoaPad&#151;the free and simple alternative.

<p><b>About this reference</b>

<p>This reference was written as, well, a reference!  If you ever need some information on CocoaPad, you can look it up here!  The references are written in tutorial format, but this is organized as a reference.

<p>This reference also use some special conventions:

<div id="sidebar">
Sometimes, there are things worth getting your attention.  They stand out because they are grouped in a box, which catches your eye.  These type of group boxes are called sidebars.
</div>

<table width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="32"><img src="../images/note.png" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><div id="message"><b>Note</b> icons are tips or facts that aren't crucial to read.</div></td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="32"><img src="../images/caution.png" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><div id="message"><b>Caution</b> icons warn you that something has potential harm.</div></td></tr></table>

<table width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="32"><img src="../images/stop.png" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><div id="message"><b>Stop</b> icons are crucial warnings that contain very important information; you should read these before continuing.</div></td></tr></table>

<div id="taskbox">
<h2>This is a taskbox</h2>
<ul>
<li>It lists the steps necessary to complete a task.
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Keyboard shortcuts and the Command key</h2>

<p>Whenever we say "Command-S", for example, we mean hold the <b>Command</b> key (the key next to the spacebar with a cloverleaf and an Apple logo on it), and press the <b>S</b> key.  Then let go of both keys.  "Command-click" means hold <b>Command</b>, click the mouse, then let go of <b>Command</b>.  The same thing applies to all of the "modifier" keys surrounding the spacebar.  For example, an often-used command is "Control-click", which means, you guessed it, hold <b>Control</b>, click the mouse, then let go of <b>Control</b>.

<p><b>What about TextEdit?</b>

<p>You probably have a perfectly self-respectable text editor called TextEdit sitting in your Applications folder.  What's wrong with that?

<p>Well, TextEdit may have its own wrap-to-page editing mode, but other than that, CocoaPad betters TextEdit in its cool little "utilities" that do even cooler things. Plus, there are little things here and there that make CocoaPad great, like how CocoaPad applies your preferences when you set them. And does TextEdit have an automatic backup feature?

<p>Of course, CocoaPad is nowhere from perfect. More features will be added with future releases. Perhaps we'll get wrap-to-page sometime soon&#133;

<p><b>The Source Code?</b>

<p>If you're a programmer, why do we give away the source code <i>for free?</i>  Because knowledge should be shared, that's why!  Sharing the source code allows other developers to benefit from the code, and they can help us perfect CocoaPad while they're at it!
