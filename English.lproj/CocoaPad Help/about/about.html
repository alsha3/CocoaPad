<h1>About CocoaPad</h1>
</div>
<p>CocoaPad is a simple Mac OS X word processor that's one-of-a-kind.  It can do regular word processing, supports images, can open RTF and text files, and it also has a few features of its own (like CAPITALIZING text).

<p><b>About this version</b>

<p>Version 1.1 fixes a couple of annoying bugs from the initial release:

<ul>
<li>CocoaPad now opens Word documents correctly.
<li>The bug where saving makes the cursor revert to the place you last typed has been fixed.
</ul>

<p><b>The Joy of Open Source</b>

<p>For other programmers who want to see a real program's code, so they can get started on their <i>own</i> programs, CocoaPad is Open Source.  That means <i>anyone</i> can see the source.  That also means they can discuss bugs, improve it, etc.  Of course, they <i>could</i> steal it, but this is such a simple program, it wouldn't be worth much.
