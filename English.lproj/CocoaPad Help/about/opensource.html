<h1>The Source Code</h1>
</div>
<p>Since CocoaPad is open source, the source code is given away.  The code, along with some other stuff, is located in the <code>/Extras/Source/</code> folder on your installer disk image.  The actual Xcode project files and Objective-C source code are in the <code>/Extras/Source/Source Code/</code> folder.

<table width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="32"><img src="../images/stop.png" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><div id="message">The project files require Mac OS X 10.3 Panther and Xcode Tools 1.0 or later (they are <code>.xcode</code> files).  The source files (<code>.h</code> and <code>.m</code> files) can be viewed with any text editor.</div></td></tr></table> 

<p>Be sure to read the README in the <code>Source/</code> folder, so you know which files are which, how to build, etc.

<p>Although CocoaPad is relatively simple, you might want to understand the code better. That's why we've included the <code>Developer Notes</code> file, which contains notes on the program, the files, etc.  Developer Notes is located in <code>/Extras/Source/</code>.

<p>If you have problems, you can always contact me at <a href="mailto:betacheese@gmail.com">betacheese@gmail.com</a>.

<p>Have fun!
