<h1>About the ruler</h1>
</div>
<p>You probably noticed that there is a big, fat ruler on your document's window, and it makes CocoaPad look like a lean, mean word processor.  Well, it's a lot more than decoration.  It has a lot of useful functions, and you might want to learn how to use them.

<ul>
<li>The first and most intriguing feature of the ruler are the <i>Tab stops</i>.  These are those little arrows on the bottom of the ruler.  If you move them, you can control how big the tab spacing is.

<table width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="32"><img src="../images/note.png" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><div id="message">There are several different types of tab stops, each with the power to control part of the layout.  One of the most useful (and most ignored) type of tabs is the indentation tab.  For more on paragraph indentation, see the <a href="indentation.html">Indentation</a> section.</div></td></tr></table>

<li>Probably the most useful function, the ruler also has <i>Alignment buttons</i>.  Click these to centralize your text, make it left-justified, and so on.
<li>If you have Mac OS X 10.3 Panther, you also have a Styles and Spacing pulldown menu.  You can adjust the line spacing and your text style without either having to make a trip up to the menu, or memorizing keyboard shortcuts.  As a bonus, you can edit stylesheets from this menu.  Stylesheets are an advanced way of saving certain preset formats.  We go into more detail in <a href="stylesheets.html">Stylesheets</a>.
</ul>

<p>Plus, the ruler also looks really cool and makes CocoaPad look like a $300 word processor, although it isn't.

<table width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="32"><img src="../images/note.png" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><div id="message">Due to a bug with Mac OS X's text system (which is, therefore, out of our control), tab stops will not save their positions if there is no text in the document and the document is saved.  The next time you open the document, the tab stops will be in their default locations.  To prevent this, make sure you have (or are planning to type) some text in your document when you edit the tab stops.</div></td></tr></table>
