<p>CocoaPad may be simple, but it's a powerful word processor.  It supports such advanced typography features such as kerning, ligatures, writing direction, etc., previously only found in big, expensive page layout programs.

<p>If you want to use these features, explore the Font and Text menus.  However, we'll quickly cover what you can do:

<ul>
<li><b>Kern</b> (in the <b>Font</b> menu): Used to alter the amount of space between letters.  Use the <b>Tighten</b> command to scrunch letters together, the <b>Loosen</b> command to widen them apart, and the <b>Use Default</b> or <b>Use None</b> command to return them to normal.
<li><b>Ligatures</b> (in the <b>Font</b> menu): Ligatures are fancy characters made from usually two letters (such as fl and fi) that have parts of their characters joined with the other one.  Choosing <b>Use Default</b> or <b>Use All</b> will substitute, for example, fi, with the appropriate ligature.  Choosing <b>Use None</b> will get rid of ligatures.  Not all fonts, such as Helvetica, have ligatures, but a lot, such as New York, Charcoal, and Hoefler Text, support ligatures.
<li><b>Baseline</b> (in the <b>Font</b> menu): The baseline controls how far text dips below or rises up from the norm.  Choose <b>Raise</b> to raise text bit by bit above normal level, and <b>Lower</b> to lower text bit by bit below normal level.  The Baseline menu also comes with two handy commands, <b>Superscript</b> and <b>Subscript</b>, which are essentially predefined baseline levels for your text.  You probably already know what these do.  <b>Superscript</b> raises text above the line, which can be useful in math equations, like (x + y)<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> + 2xy + y<sup>2</sup>.  <b>Subscript</b> lowers text below the line, and can be useful in chemical formulas (for example, CO<sub>2</sub>).
<li><b>Character Shape</b> (in the <b>Font</b> menu): Some fonts offer special ways of making characters&#151;the sole item in this submenu toggles the character shape between Traditional Form and the font's specialized character shapes.  According to Apple, "This feature is currently used to specify traditional shapes in Chinese and Japanese scripts, but font developers could use it for other scripts as well."
<li><b>Copy Style</b> and <b>Paste Style</b> (in the <b>Font</b> menu): Used to copy and paste text with formatting intact.
<li><b>Writing Direction</b> (in the <b>Text</b> menu): Select <b>Right to Left</b> to toggle right to left writing, where text types from the right to the left.
</ul>
