<p>CocoaPad has some handy little features that can capitalize your text, or convert your document to RTF format (see <a href="../advanced/formats.html">All about file formats</a>).  Here's a rundown of these miscellaneous tools:

<div id="sidebar">
<ul>
<li><b>CAPITALIZE Selected Text:</b> Capitalizes the selected text (or all of the text if nothing is selected).
<li><b>Make Selected Text lowercase:</b> Makes the selected text (or all of the text if nothing is selected) to lowercase.
<li><b>Capitalize First Letter Of Each Word:</b> Capitalizes the first letter of each word in the selected text (or all of the text if nothing is selected).
<li><b>Word Count:</b> Shows you how many words, paragraphs, and characters there are currently in your document.
<li><b>Change Background Color:</b> Changes the background color of your document.  This is only temporary though&#151;it will not be saved.  This utility cannot be undone once it is used.
<li><b>Convert to CocoaPad format:</b> Enables your document to be saved in CocoaPad format (see <a href="../advanced/formats.html">All about file formats</a>).  The conversion cannot be undone once it is used.  However, you can always convert your document <i>back</i> to the original format.
<li><b>Convert to Rich Text Format:</b> Enables your document to be saved in Rich Text Format (see <a href="../advanced/formats.html">All about file formats</a>).  The conversion cannot be undone once it is used.  However, you can always convert your document <i>back</i> to the original format (although you won't get your graphics back).
<li><b>Convert to Rich Text Format with Attachments:</b> Enables your document to be saved in Rich Text Format with Attachments (see <a href="../advanced/formats.html">All about file formats</a>).  The conversion cannot be undone once it is used.  However, you can always convert your document <i>back</i> to the original format.
<li><b>Convert to Microsoft Word Format:</b> Enables your document to be saved in Microsoft Word format, yes, <i>Word</i> format (see <a href="../advanced/formats.html">All about file formats</a>).  The conversion cannot be undone once it is used.  However, you can always convert your document <i>back</i> to the original format (although you won't get your graphics back).
<li><b>Convert to Plain text format:</b> Enables your document to be saved in Plain text format (see <a href="../advanced/formats.html">All about file formats</a>).  The conversion cannot be undone once it is used.  However, you can always convert your document <i>back</i> to the original format (although you won't get your graphics and formatting back).
</ul>

<p>These are all found in the <b>Format</b> menu.
