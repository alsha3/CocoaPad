<h1>Smart Quotes</h1>
</div>
<p>If you've ever used a major, name-brand word processor before (like Microsoft Word), you may take for granted that your quotation marks and apostrophes look like &#147;, &#148;, &#145, and &#146;, like they should.  But notice that the keys on your keyboard look like " and ', which look "straight" compared to the typographically correct, or &#147;curly&#148; quotation marks and apostrophes.  In reality, the word processor converts your quotation marks and apostrophes (hereinafter referred to as just "quotes"), which are normally straight, into curly quotes.  You may have noticed this if you used programs like TextEdit or BBEdit, which do not have a "smart quotes" feature.

<p>CocoaPad is still a kind of word processor, though, and, yes, it has Smart Quotes.  If Smart Quotes is enabled in the preferences panel, CocoaPad will automatically generate curly quotes instead of straight quotes, not only making your documents look more professional, but also (if you're a power user) saving you the of time and effort of remembering the special keystroke to insert curly quotes.

<p>Smart Quotes is turned on by default, so you shouldn't have to do any configuring to be able to type curly quotes.
