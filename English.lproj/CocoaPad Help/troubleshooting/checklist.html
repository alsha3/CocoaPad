<h1>Troubleshooting Checklist</h1>
</div>
<p>Something gone screwy in CocoaPad?  Before breaking out in a sweaty panic, try the following steps:
<div id="taskbox">
<ol>
<li>Search the online help system for your "problem."  It could be "a feature, not a bug" (in other words, a different way of doing things).
<li>Was there an error message?  Did it tell you anything about the problem?  Even if it didn't, you should write it down anyway.
<li>Quit CocoaPad and open it again.  Did the problem go away?
<li>Check to see if the bug occurs in TextEdit (in your Applications folder).  CocoaPad and other Mac OS X-exclusive programs, such as TextEdit, share the same text editing functions, which are maintained by Apple.  Bugs in Apple's text editing functions are out of our control.  Try <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/">contacting Apple</a> and reporting the bug to them.
<li>Trash CocoaPad's preference file.  Go to your home folder, open Library, open Preferences, then find a file named <b>com.htw.cocoapad.plist</b>.  Drag this file to the trash.  If the problem goes away, empty the trash.  Otherwise, drag the file back to your preferences folder.
<li>Logout, log back in as yourself, then open CocoaPad.  Sometimes, things get so crazy and jumbled that it's best to start over.
<li>As a last resort, delete CocoaPad, then reinstall it from the installer disk.
</ol>

<p>Okay, if you've followed those things, and you can't find the answer, go on to the next section.
