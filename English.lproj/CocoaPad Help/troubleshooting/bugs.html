<p>Here's a sample bug report:

<div id="sidebar">CocoaPad crashes when I change the Check Spelling As You Type preference and then click Apply To All.  I usually have only 1 or 2 documents open at a time.  I open the Preferences, click the Check Spelling As You Type checkbox, click Apply To All, then click Apply To All again to confirm, and CocoaPad crashes!  I tried restarting CocoaPad, throwing away the preferences file, logging out, and reinstalling CocoaPad.  Any ideas?</div>
